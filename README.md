# API-twitter-copy
This code uses FastAPI to create a basic Twitter-like API with data models for users and tweets. It defines routes for registering, logging in, showing, and deleting users, but does not implement the actual logic for these operations. Tweet-related operations are mentioned but not implemented in the code.
